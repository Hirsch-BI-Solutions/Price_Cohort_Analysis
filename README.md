# Price_Cohort_Analysis

I am analyzing services average price using monthly cohort analysis. 
I have centred my analysis on country code and not on client code as it could also be done.
The aim of this approach is to see average price changes on monthly cohorts in diffrent countries. 
In the images bellow you can confront the monthly average price changes with the country code distribution on monthly cohorts. 


### Country codes

- 130 - Chile
- 145 - Germany  
- 155 - Swiss
- 165 - France 
- 175 - Belgium
- 177 - Denmark
- 185 - Finland
- 188 - Luxembourg
- 190 - Netherlands
- 195 - South Africa
